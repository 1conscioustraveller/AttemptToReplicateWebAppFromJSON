# Project Structure â€” LoopGo DJ Mixer (React + Vite)

This document explains the overall **file/folder structure**, the role of each part, 
and how responsibilities were divided among LLM delegates in the role-played build process.

## ðŸ“‚ Root Directory

```

## ðŸ“‚ src/

- **main.jsx** â€” React entrypoint. Renders `<App />` into `#root`.
- **styles.css** â€” Global and component-level styles. Includes responsive rules (<768px).

### Components (`src/components/`)
- **Deck.jsx**
  - Represents one audio deck (A, B, C, or D).
  - Features:
    - Load audio file or URL.
    - Play/Pause button.
    - Independent Volume control (gain node).
    - Pitch/Speed control (`audio.playbackRate`).
  - Routes its audio through group gain (AB or CD).

- **Crossfader.jsx**
  - Horizontal slider blending between AB group and CD group.
  - Implements **equal-power crossfade curve** for smooth transitions.
  - Displays current blend value (percentage CD).

### Hooks (`src/hooks/`)
- **useMixer.js**
  - Provides `MixerContext` for Web Audio graph management.
  - Lazily initializes `AudioContext` on first user interaction (autoplay policy compliant).
  - Creates:
    - `abGain` (group gain for Decks A & B)
    - `cdGain` (group gain for Decks C & D)
    - `masterGain` (future-proofing)
  - Ensures audio graph: `<audio>` â†’ deck gain â†’ group gain â†’ master â†’ destination.

### App (`src/App.jsx`)
- Wraps everything in `<MixerProvider>` context.
- Layout:
  - **Header** with branding + description.
  - **Grid** with 4 `<Deck>` components (A, B in AB; C, D in CD).
  - **Crossfader** component.
  - **Footer** with usage tip.

## ðŸŽ­ LLM Delegate Responsibilities (Role-played)

- **Gemini** â†’ Initialize base UI skeleton (React + Vite project setup).
- **Claude** â†’ Implement independent **volume controls** per deck.
- **Llama** â†’ Add **crossfader** (2 failed retries â†’ escalated, fixed with equal-power curve).
- **DeepSeek** â†’ Implement **pitch/speed controls** (playbackRate binding).
- **Flux** â†’ Ensure **mobile-friendly styling** (bigger slider thumbs, responsive grid).
- **ChatGPT5 (Supervisor)** â†’ Reviewed escalated crossfader, verified all steps, signed off final project.

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Design Notes
- **Equal-power crossfader** prevents loudness dips during transitions.
- **Responsive sliders** ensure usability on touch devices.
- **Context-based mixer graph** allows consistent audio routing and future extensibility (effects, master controls).
- **Acceptance criteria** satisfied step-by-step, logged in governance role-play.
